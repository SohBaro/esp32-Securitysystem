# ESP32 Home Survillance System
ESP32 Home camera with buzzer and ultrasonic sensor. This is an application of Arduino ESP32 devkit in which it uses ultrasonic sensors and a sound sensor to sense objects. When it senses a object the buzzer rings and the live feed is shown to a website.

There is the Arduino Code and then there is python code called as the app.py.
Then there is the template in which you have two files, index.html, and login.html

In the arduino code you have to rename the wifi password and also enter your ip address. Right now the website is hosted on the local host. In order to host the website, you can do cloudfare tunelling to your domain name. The youtube Tutorial for that is here
